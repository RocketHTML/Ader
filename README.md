# It's not aider, it's adder 
Exchanges ads on a page with our sponsor's ads 


Basically, Google has a browser extension tutorial online that takes about 20 minutes to read, and 2 years ago Michael Gundlach had his adblock code on github for public hacking. Therefore, my friends and I made a browser extention that replaces ads, instead of blocking them.

# But Why?
We figured it would be a cheaper and more effective way for companies to advertise their merchandise. Gamers, fashionistas, and mothers could choose the ads they want to be subjected to, so companies are ONLY paying for their target audience. 

# Good Idea. I'm going to steal it. 
It's a fun project to work on, and I may continue to build it if I find someone interested in marketing. Until then, please comprehend and hack the code, and make your own ader if you're to the task. You can find screenshots of the code at work here: <insert portfolio here>
